AGD BBC Micro Port
~~~

Stream of consciousness notes

Actually 2x projects:

1. Convert existing AGD games for ZX Spectrum 48K to BBC Micro
2. Create tools for AGD games to be written for native BBC Micro

Useful factoids
~~~
Spectrum screen 256x192 = 32x24 characters (cells)
Each cell is 8x8 pixels @ 1bpp, one attribute (fg & bg colour) per cell
Spectrum defacto "lead platform"

CPC screen 160x200 = 32x25 characters
Each cell is 5x8 pixels @ 4bpp, 16 colours from palette of 27

Coordinate system 0-255
Compiler maps start positions from 0-255 to 0-159 for CPC
SPRITELEFT/SPRITERIGHT commands move sprites 2 pixels on Spectrum but 1 on CPC!

BBC Assumptions
~~~
RAM biggest challenge
MODE 4 easiest place to start - same as Atom
Shrink 320x256 screen down to 256x192 as per Spectrum
Saves 2K RAM over standard MODE 4

Assume 32K ModelB is lowest common denominator
Let someone else do the Electron version
Going to be hard to support higher res/colour screen modes without extra RAM

For Spectrum conversions, don't want to attempt to autoconvert the sprites
So leave at Spectrum resolution
Would be nice to support MODE 1 on Master or with extra SWRAM
Ideal would be build once then have "May I use your swram?" question at start
Then switch MODE 4/MODE 1 at that point with same data

Need way to map Spectrum 16 colour palette to 4x colours of MODE 1

For BBC native, more likely to be like CPC screen and use 160x256
so either MODE 5 (lower RAM) or MODE 2 (higher RAM)

Could use 2bpp sprites with individual palette similar to POP
Although need to think about how to shift them to per-pixel plotting in MODE 5
(Maybe a similar approach would work using the stack?)
Sprites are also fixed size so this helps a lot.

No masking..!
All sprites are erased and redrawn with EOR to screen buffer
If implementing masking then would need to find a different way to restore screen
Ala POP
Instead use 3 fg and 4 bg colour approach? Simpler and then 4 colour mode just
merges those two palettes.  E.g. only use FG palette in 4 colour MODE.

>> Would still want to check the LUTs on a per-screen basis

Memory map
~~~
Engine code &1100 - &262E = &152E
Approaching 22 pages ~= 5.5K

Map properties buffer = 3 pages = 768 bytes
Screen address tables = 2 pages = 512 bytes
Shrapnel table = 330 bytes

Game starts at &2C80
Full MODE 4 screen starts at &5800
Spectrum sized screen starts at &6800

Leaves &3B80 (15232) < 15K for game & data

Can relocate everything down from &1100

But eg. Roust finishes at &7F49
Size = &52C9 (21193) bytes < ~21K for game & data
Going to be impossible to save &17 pages...
Can maybe get &E pages back...

Some Spectrum games will be able to run MODE 1 unexpanded
Depending on RAM requirements:
- MODE 1 unexpanded
- MODE 4 unexpanded, MODE 1 expanded
- Expanded only, MODE 1
- Exapnded only, MODE 4

E.g. Roust
Script &2CA0 - &649F = &3800 (14K!)
Data &64A0 - &7F50 = &1AB0 (6.7K)

E.g. Dodgy
Script &2C80 - &300A = &38A (<1K)
Data &300A - &38B2 = &8A8 (>2K)

E.g. Terrapins
Engine = &E00 - &2CD0 = &1ED0 (<8K)
Script = &2CD0 - &52D0 = &2F00 (~12K) became &2AAF (saved &451 bytes using ZP vars)
Data = &7C10 - &52D0 = &2940 (~10K)
Screen = &6800 - &8000 = &1800 (6K)
Free = &1F00 - &6800 = &4900 (~18K)

Could potentially create a code optimiser down the line
Only uses A register with Y as index to indirect ptr
(Mainly manipulating sprites in a table)

Lots of repeatedly loading the immedaite values into a register
Could optimise repeated values in theory
Engine "write instruction" actually just writes a string to the file
Could change this so the compiler understand the instruction being written
Load / store / register / address etc.
Then could remove redundant loads of same immediate values

Lots of copying variables from one location to another
Challenge is that commands result in sequences like:
 load spr1.x store work.x
 load spr1.y store work.y
 load work.x store plot.x
 load work.y store plot.y
So would need to figure out ability to reorder CPU instructions between commands
I.e. do all X first then all Y

Need to start brushing up on languages & compiler theory...

Easy MOS RAM to steal:
&300 - &400 = VDU workspace (1 page)
&400 - &800 = Language workspace (4 pages)
&800 - &9BF = Sound workspace (keep for audio)
&9C0 - &C00 = CFS & Soft key (&240)
&C00 - &D00 = Character defs (keep for font)
&D00 - &E00 = NMI etc. (leave alone)
&E00 = Free

Easy ZP to steal:
&00 - &A0 = Language workspace + Econet workspace

Needs
MAP = 3x pages = &300 - &600
SCREEN ADDRESS TABLES = 2x pages (could be reduced) = &600 - &800
SHRAPNEL TABLE = 330 = &14A bytes = &B00 - 330
SPRITE TABLE = &B00 - &C00

Moving all variables to ZP saved 1K of script from Terrapins!!
Still over by 4K though...

Could save another page by copying font data over BBC char defs...
